## ACT I: THE PROMISE OF ACTIVE INFERENCE ON THE EDGE

### The Problem
In industrial predictive maintenance, the standard approach is supervised Deep Learning. We gather petabytes of vibration data from failing machines, train massive GPU-bound Neural Networks, and deploy them on edge servers. It works, but it's fundamentally flawed. Fault data is expensive, rare, and impossible to collect for every conceivable breakdown. Even worse, running these models requires continuous Floating-Point (FFT) calculations, mandating energy-hungry processors. In a world moving towards battery-powered, billion-node IoT Mesh networks, the current paradigm is a thermodynamic dead end.

### The NATIVA Hypothesis
What if we approached machine health like biological immunity? A biological organism doesn't need to have seen every possible virus to know it's sick; it simply knows what "healthy" feels like, and reacts to any deviation. 
This is the principle of Unsupervised Active Inference (Karl Friston's Free Energy Principle). 

NATIVA (Neuromorphic Active Inference for Vibrational Anomalies) was born to translate this neuroscientific theory into cold, hard industrial C code. The architecture:
1. Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) using Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons.
2. Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) for unsupervised learning of the "healthy rhythm".
3. Active Inference (Free Energy) to score the "Surprise" when the rhythm breaks.

The goal: Detect any bearing fault using a sub-mW microcontroller, entirely without labels, by simply listening to the machine until it learns its normal state.

### The TinyML Illusion vs. The True "Plug & Learn" Rupture
Today’s Edge AI relies on "frozen weights." You train a compressed Random Forest or CNN in the cloud, flash it to a microcontroller, and deploy it. But machines age. Seasons change. A frozen model suffers from Concept Drift, eventually leading to false alarms. Worse, if you install a new pump, you must acquire new fault data, retrain on a server, and re-flash. The current paradigm is "Record $\rightarrow$ Label $\rightarrow$ Cloud $\rightarrow$ Train $\rightarrow$ Flash". It is heavy and unscalable.

The true rupture of NATIVA is not just being lightweight; it is destroying this vicious cycle. Because it relies on Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and Active Inference, it learns and adapts entirely *on-device*, without backpropagation. It is the ultimate "Plug & Learn" sensor. You attach it to any healthy machine, provided the physics of impact apply. It calibrates its own Free Energy baseline in minutes, and continuously adapts to slow environmental changes while remaining hyper-sensitive to mechanical anomalies. No cloud, no datasets, no frozen weights. It is a living algorithm.

## ACT II: THE PHYSICAL WALL (The Battle with the Encoders)

### The Stumbling Block
NATIVA's first tests on the standard CWRU bearing dataset were a disaster: 0.50 AUC (pure chance). The SNN brain was functioning, but its "eyes"—the signal encoder—were blind. Applying standard per-window normalization destroyed the amplitude differences between healthy and faulty states.

*Breakthrough 1: Global Normalization.* By calibrating the threshold on the global 99th percentile of healthy data, the network suddenly achieved 0.997 AUC. 

### Re-discovering the No Free Lunch Theorem
But the joy was short-lived. Testing on cross-conditions (the 1HP load) revealed harsh drops in accuracy. The standard linear STFT encoder was lumping the fault frequencies (BPFO at 105 Hz) into the exact same band as the healthy baseline noise. We tried a Mel-Scale logarithmic encoder (standard in speech recognition). It crashed the reliability completely (0.69 AUC). 

*The Physical Lesson:* Mel-scale compresses high frequencies. But bearing spalling (holes in the metal) creates sharp impacts that excite high-frequency structural resonances (>2kHz). We realized that *an AI algorithm is nothing if its sensory interface doesn't respect the underlying physics of the sensor.*

## ACT III: NATIVA 1.0 - THE FRUGAL MASTERPIECE

### Killing the FFT
To bypass the energy-draining STFT entirely, we engineered a Time-Domain Envelope (Envelope V2). We applied a high-pass IIR filter (>2kHz) to isolate the metallic resonance, rectified the signal, and extracted the moving average of the impacts. We then fed this rhythm into the SNN.

*The Result:* A perfect 1.000 AUC on all 36 CWRU conditions. 

### The Industrial Translation
We then ported this entire architecture into Bare-Metal C. 
The pipeline—from signal envelope to STDP learning and Free Energy scoring—compiled down to just 4.7 KB of RAM. It consumed 0.2% of a standard Cortex-M4 CPU, requiring zero external libraries, zero mallocs, and zero FFTs. 

We had built the ultimate "Wake-Up Sensor". A piece of software so light it could run for years on a coin cell battery, constantly monitoring the machine's Free Energy, only waking up the heavy diagnostic radios when an anomaly was geometrically certain.

## ACT IV: THE INSTRUCTIVE FAILURE & THE TAXONOMY OF OBSERVABILITY

### The Paderborn Reality Check
We took NATIVA 1.0 and threw it at the Paderborn University dataset. The score plummeted to 0.450. 
Why? Because Paderborn doesn't feature sharp, impulsive impacts (spalling). It features distributed abrasive wear (fatigue). The metal doesn't ring; it grinds. 

### The Flat Dual Encoder Crash
We attempted a naive fusion: feeding both the high-frequency Envelope and the raw broadband noise into the same SNN. 
*The Result:* "Competitive Starvation". The continuous broadband noise overwhelmed the STDP learning rule, starving the Envelope synapses. The network went totally deaf. We learned that bio-inspired AI requires strictly separated cortical columns to avoid sensory interference.

### The Neuromorphic Hack (Jeffress Model) and the Assassination of the FFT
To detect the periodic, low-frequency grinding of Paderborn (KA03) without resorting to the heavy computation of a standard FFT, we implemented a Delay-Line Coincidence detector. Inspired by how owls locate sound (The Jeffress Model). Using only simple bitwise shifts (virtual shift registers, $\Delta t$) in C, the SNN found the hidden temporal autocorrelation in the noise. 

Reducing a complex spectral analysis task to simple binary shifts (logical AND) for a few kilobytes of RAM is an absolute engineering hack. The score for the KA03 condition skyrocketed from 0.256 to 0.987, still keeping the global memory footprint under 12 KB. It stands as definitive proof that a neuromorphic approach can defeat classical algorithms on their own turf: the `Power Consumption / Detection` ratio.

### The Taxonomy of the Physical Wall
This journey crystallized the fundamental truth of predictive maintenance. AI does not create information. We classified bearing faults into three physical tiers of observability for a single accelerometer:
1. **Impulsive Faults (CWRU):** Sharp impacts. Solved trivially by the Envelope V2 (4.7 KB).
2. **Periodic Non-Impulsive (Paderborn KA03):** Rhythmic grinding. Solved by Delay-Line Coincidence (<12 KB).
3. **Aperiodic Continuous (Paderborn KA05):** Standard pink noise with shifting variance. **The Physical Wall.** 

An accelerometer alone cannot distinguish an aperiodic abrasive wear (KA05) from a machine simply spinning faster under load (changing RMS variance). Any algorithm trying to do so with one sensor will inevitably trigger false alarms in a real factory.

## ACT V: THE ULTIMATE VISION (Distributed Active Inference)

If NATIVA hit the physical wall of the single sensor, what is the next step? This is where Friston's theory of Markov Blankets comes into devastating industrial play.

The future of Edge AI is not a heavier algorithm on a single chip. It is **Distributed Active Inference.**

Imagine an IoT Mesh Network where one NATIVA node listens to vibrations, another listens to acoustics, and a third measures motor current. Each node runs its ultra-light 4.7 KB loop locally. They do NOT beam massive gigabytes of raw waveforms over Wi-Fi. 
Instead, they only transmit binary "Spikes of Surprise" to each other. 
When the vibration node senses an increase in energy, it spikes. If the acoustic node confirms a simultaneous shift in its Free Energy, they reach a distributed consensus: the machine is failing. If only the vibration node spikes, they know it’s just a change in machine load.

NATIVA is no longer just an anomaly detector. It is the mathematical framework for how the next generation of neuromorphic micro-sensors will communicate, saving terawatts of radio energy while solving problems that are physically impossible for a single node to see.

## ACT VI: CURRENT STATUS & THE OPEN INVITATION

NATIVA is no longer a theoretical concept. We have reached Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4.

**The Code:** The NATIVA 1.0 (Envelope V2) architecture is fully written in Bare-Metal C, independently verifiable, and achieves 1.000 AUC on the CWRU benchmark utilizing under 5 KB of RAM.
**The Research:** The complete documentation of our methodology, including the Jeffress Delay-Line solution for the Paderborn periodic faults, is formally validated.

**The Ask:** We are now opening the doors to hardware integration. We are actively looking for Silicon Partners (Neuromorphic chip designers) and Industrial Integrators who want to move beyond FFTs and frozen TinyML models, and deploy the first Distributed Active Inference mesh networks on real-world machinery.
